## Description
This program pulls data from two csv files: bitstamp.csv and coinbase.csv. Both have thousands of lines of data on Bitcoin prices spanning several years. This program collects, organizes, and prepares the data in these files for analysis. Part of this analysis is determining the arbitrage profits from various dates in both data sets. Once the data is collected and prepared, it is put into line and box plots for a more visual analysis.
